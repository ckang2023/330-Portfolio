# 330-Portfolio

This is the repository for my portfolio website. 

The website is designed for the Google Chrome browser.

The notes and explanations below are also included in my Canvas comment section of my submission. 

**Additional Notes**
Among the three showcase projects presented on the portfolio homepage, only the AI project is clickable and will direct the users to a separate project description page. The project description page is created as project.html.
All three project can expand and show a short description when hovering over. 

**Extra Credit Explanations**
For one of the extra credit features, I did the integration of external contents. Since this item requires verbal explanation, I provided them below. 

- External Content Integration
I integrated two types of external contents: YouTube video and Google Calendar. 

I integrated YouTube video on my bio webpage, because my singing talent is an important part about me. Thus, I think the best way to directly showcase my talent to the users is to include a video of me singing in the “talent gallery” section on my bio page. A representative task that can be supported by this integration is when a recruiter wants to know my talents and interests besides my academic-related performances. They can go to the “bio” page from the top menu bar on the portfolio homepage. Scrolling down to the “talent gallery” section, they can access my recorded singing video on YouTube and get a clear idea about my singing talent. 

I integrated Google Calendar on my contact webpage, because it is important and helpful for people who wants to contact me to know my schedule and available times. A representative task can be when a recruiter sees my background matches a position they are recruiting for and wants to contact me. They want to get a brief idea about the ways to reach me and my available times in this month. They can go to the “contact” page from the top menu bar, accessing my contact info and view my schedule for this month via the integrated Google calendar.
